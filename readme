MinSon Discord bot coded in C#
Need to add config.json for the bot to work, in project/bin/debug/net.0/ ( Not included in repo )
config.json should contain a token and a prefix.
token is the bots id.
prefix is what you type before a command, ie to do helloworld command you would type prefixhelloworld

Bot wont know commands not registered in bot.cs.

if you have questions contact www.maxhendess@gmail.com .
